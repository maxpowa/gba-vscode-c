# Gameboy Advance VSCode Environment

Requires devkitPro/devkitARM + libgba installed for `F5` auto-launch.

### Resources

libGBA
 - http://starflakenights.net/libraries/devkitpro-libgba/docs/html/ (very outdated)
 - Probably best to just use Intellisense from the header files

Tonc
 - https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm
 - Not sure why, but can't get it to properly include in the Makefile, so this is just for reference
